P3T - Countdown timers for Nintendo DS
======================================
P3T provides a bunch of independent countdown timers, which can be
started, stopped and programmed individually. A sound is emitted when
a timer reaches the end of its countdown.


Usage
-----
After booting, you will be greeted by a screen containing eight timers:
each one is marked with a number, and sports a retro–looking eight segment
display to show the remaining time.

Tap a timer to switch to control mode. In this mode, only the timer
you have tapped is displayed, and three control buttons are shown
besides it.

The first button, the one with the exclamation mark on it, is the action
button. Tap it when the timer is stopped, and it will start; tap it when
the timer is running, and it will pause it; tap it when the timer has
reached the end of its countdown, and it will get ready to be started
again. You get the idea.

The second and third buttons can be used to increase or decrease the
target time. If the timer is running, it will be stopped.

Tap the timer again to go back to overview mode. That’s it.


Installation
------------
Just drop the .nds file into your SD/CF card. The program doesn’t access
the card, so there’s no need to DLDI patch it.


Source code
-----------
The lastest version of the P3T source code can be obtained by running
the following command:

	git clone http://kiyuko.org/git/p3t.git

You’ll need devkitPro, along with libnds and maxmod, to build it.


Bugs
----
None I know of, but of course let me know if you find any. You can use my
e–mail address <eof@kiyuko.org> also to suggest any feature you’d like to
see implemented in a future release of P3T.
